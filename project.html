            Input of users will be caught through Post and Get methods and flask routes will deal with the inputs and render corresponding HTML files.
            Utilized BeautfiulSoup 4 to get the desired information (games categories display, steam games status etc) by crawling related URLs, fetched and cached each game’s specific information. Used sqlite3 as the database and temporally stored all data into tables.
            Fetched and cached data are organized into HTML files and SCSS are added to adjust the layout.
