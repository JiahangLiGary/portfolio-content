				<h1> About me: </h1>
				<p>
					My name is Jiahang Li, you can also call me Garry. This website is created for my SI 539 web design course.
					I am a master student at the University of Michigan in Electrical & Computer Science Department.
					I mainly focus on the Computer Vision area. Previously, I got a bachelor degree as a mechanical engineer.
					But I found that I love more about programming and coding instead of analyzing the forces and energy,
					because I always know what I am doing and it's easier to get a sense of achievement. So I processed the dual degree
					in EECS. Besides my interests in computer vision and machine learning, I also have passion in self-driving cars and 
					the robots perception and control filed.

					I mainly take courses at Electrical & Computer Science Department and School of Information.
					I am a research assistant in 3D microstructure reconstruction and image analysis.
					In my spare time, I would like to play some video games for relaxing.   I am good at playing many games, 
					such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,FINAL FANTASY XIV, Monster Hunter series.
					The picture above shows my favorite hero in League of Legends. 
					Above the game I have mentioned, if they have specific ranks, I always get my rank beyond platinum.
					I also enjoy night running, I enjoy the feeling that wind gently blows my cheeks. I lost 25 kilograms this way.
