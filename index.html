            My name is Jiahang Li, you can also call me Garry.
            I am a master student at the University of Michigan in Electrical & Computer Science Department.
            I mainly focus on the Computer Vision area. Previously I get a bachelor degree as a mechanical engineer.
            But I found that I love more about programming and coding instead of analyzing the forces and energy,
            because I always know what I am doing and it's easier to get a sense of achievement.

            In my spare time, I would like to play some video games for relaxing.   I am good at many games, such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,FINAL FANTASY XIV, Monster Hunter series.
